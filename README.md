# Abstract

Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs), characterized by the loss of *SMARCB1*, are among the most lethal pediatric central nervous system (CNS) tumors. Three molecular subtypes have been identified, each defined by distinct molecular and clinical features. No subtype-specific treatments are available, highlighting the need to better understand inter- and intra-subtype heterogeneity. Here, we generated a single-nucleus transcriptome atlas of ATRTs, validated by single-cell ATAC-seq and spatial transcriptomics, to study subtype-specific differentiation trajectories. We identified brain progenitor-like expression profiles within unique subtype-specific differentiation lineages. A shared cycling, progenitor-like cell population, interspersed throughout tumors, was observed across all ATRT samples. Moreover, we demonstrate that subtype-specific differentiation trajectories can be induced pharmacologically in ATRT tumoroids directing tumor cells towards a non-proliferative, mature phenotype. Our study reveals that ATRT subtypes exhibit signaling trajectories mirroring normal fetal brain development, potentially enabling the development of maturation therapies tailored towards ATRTs.
